# Next Typescript Starter kit
Next Typescript Starter kit (NTSK) is a boiler plate use to simplify my development under Next. 
NTSK mixes the base of my configuration, the folder tree and most of my helpers, hooks, ... NTSK also includes the integration of Redux and my translation manager and my nextCLI to save time on file creation.

7. [Translation](#translation)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## NextCLI
[Take a look on NextCLI ReadMe](https://github.com/yanntouil/next-ts-starterkit/tree/main/nextCLI#config)
## Translation
Translation manager is base on [Laravel Localization](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/localization). 
I left the use to recreate a javascript version and currently React version base on Hooks and Redux to facilitate the creation and use of translation files.
